	abstract = {A previously developed approach for the numerical treatment of two particles that are confined in a finite optical-lattice potential and interact via an arbitrary isotropic interaction potential has been extended to incorporate an additional anisotropic dipole–dipole interaction (DDI). The interplay of a model but realistic short-range Born–Oppenheimer potential and the DDI for two confined particles is investigated. A variation of the strength of the DDI leads to diverse resonance phenomena. In a harmonic confinement potential some resonances show similarities to s-wave scattering resonances while in an anharmonic trapping potential like the one of an optical lattice additional inelastic confinement-induced dipolar resonances occur. The latter are due to a coupling of the relative and center-of-mass motion caused by the anharmonicity of the external confinement.}
